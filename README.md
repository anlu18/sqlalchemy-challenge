## Climate Data Analysis and Exploration

### Overview
This project involves analyzing and exploring climate data stored in the `hawaii.sqlite` database. The analysis was performed in the `climate.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook, where precipitation and station data were explored. Additionally, a Flask-based climate application (`app.py`) was developed to serve climate information via a RESTful API with five different routes, each returning JSON-formatted climate data.

### Precipitation Analysis

- **Data Retrieval:**
  - ORM queries were performed to retrieve the date and precipitation (`prcp`) data for the previous 12 months from the database.
  
- **DataFrame Creation:**
  - A Pandas DataFrame was created from the queried data to facilitate further analysis.



- **Visualization:**
  - The results were visualized using the Pandas `plot` method, generating a plot of the precipitation data over the past year.

- **Summary Statistics:**
  - A summary statistics table was generated for the precipitation data, providing insights into the distribution of rainfall over the previous 12 months.

  Summary Statistics:
  ```
  precipitation
  count    2021.000000
  mean        0.177279
  std         0.461190
  min         0.000000
  25%         0.000000
  50%         0.020000
  75%         0.130000
  max         6.700000
  ```

### Station Analysis

- **Station Activity:**
  - All weather stations in the dataset were listed with their corresponding observation counts in descending order, identifying the most active stations.

  Example:
  ```
  [('USC00519281', 2772),
   ('USC00519397', 2724),
   ('USC00513117', 2709),
   ('USC00519523', 2669),
   ('USC00516128', 2612),
   ('USC00514830', 2202),
   ('USC00511918', 1979),
   ('USC00517948', 1372),
   ('USC00518838', 511)]
  ```

- **Temperature Analysis:**
  - For the most active station, the minimum, average, and maximum temperatures were queried.
  - The temperature observations (`tobs`) for the last 12 months at the most active station were also retrieved.

  

- **Temperature Distribution:**
  - The temperature data was binned and visualized using a histogram, generated via the Pandas `histogram` method.

### Climate API Development

- **Flask API:**
  - A Climate API was built using Flask to serve the analyzed data through various endpoints. The following routes are available:

  1. **Homepage (`/`):**
     - Lists all the available routes for the API.

  2. **Precipitation Data (`/api/v1.0/precipitation`):**
     - Retrieves the last 12 months of precipitation data and returns a JSON dictionary where the dates are keys and the precipitation values are the associated values.

  3. **Stations Data (`/api/v1.0/stations`):**
     - Returns a JSON list of all weather stations from the dataset.

  4. **Temperature Observations (`/api/v1.0/tobs`):**
     - Queries and returns a JSON list of temperature observations from the most active station for the previous year.

  5. **Temperature Summary by Date Range (`/api/v1.0/<start>` and `/api/v1.0/<start>/<end>`):**
     - Returns a JSON list of the minimum, average, and maximum temperatures for a specified date range.
     - For a single start date, the temperatures are calculated for all dates greater than or equal to the start date.
     - For a start and end date, the temperatures are calculated for the dates within that range, inclusive.
